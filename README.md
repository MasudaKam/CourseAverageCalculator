I created this Java program to calculate a student's course average and letter grade based on three exam scores.
It asks the user for their first and last name, collects their exam scores, calculates the average, and determines the letter grade using a standard grading scale.
I used the printf method to format the output so that itâ€™s clean and easy to read.
